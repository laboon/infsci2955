# IS2955 - Software Quality Assurance
Summer Semester 2015
DUE 29 JUL 2015

## Deliverable 5 - THE FINAL DELIVERABLE

For this assignment, you will perform some software testing of whatever kind you find interesting.  It can be from the following list of topics gone over in class, or you can research and use your own.  If you are using your own, please check with me before working on it.  You may work alone or in a group of two (with a partner of your choice).

### Possible Ideas (not an exhaustive list!)

1. Deeper testing of a web application (perhaps including JavaScript)
2. Performance testing of an application
3. Rewriting an application to be more test-friendly (e.g. Coffee Maker Quest)
3. Security Testing
3. Penetration Testing (be sure it's on something you HAVE PERMISSION TO DO!)
5. Combinatorial Testing
6. Property-Based Testing
7. Formal Analysis of a program
8. Algorithmic analysis of a combinatorial algorithm
9. Writing a new app from scratch using TDD
10. Adding tests to an existing program 
11. In-depth metrics analysis (code coverage, etc.) of a project

The final project should be approximately as much work as earlier assignments for this class.  Please see the grading rubric below for how the final deliverable will be graded.

You may use a project you have already worked on, or a totally new one if you prefer.  Any tests and/or code should be on GitHub or another publicly accessible repository.

The quality of your write-up can and will impact your grade.  For a perfect grade, I expect
professional quality on ALL aspects of your testing, including:

1. Proper grammar, punctuation, etc.
2. No commented-out code, UNLESS there is a specified reason for it, e.g.:
   * `// This doesn't work, but this is what I would do if I could...`
   * `// Uncomment the following line to run additional long-running tests)`
3. No inconsistent spacing/tabs/brace settings.  I don't care which you use, but make
    it consistent.
4. Good variable names, good coding style in general.

* **Perfect Score** - Absolutely no problems, working on a challenging system with excellent
   test coverage.  Tests and kinds of tests make perfect sense and are described well.
   Summary, testing concerns, and quality assessment are easy to read with no grammatical
   errors.
* **A** - Minor problems, working on a reasonable system with good test coverage.  Tests and
   kinds of tests are appropriate and described well.  Summary, testing concerns, and
   quality assessment have only minor issues.
* **B** - A few issues, but overall decent test coverage.  Tests and kinds of tests could have
     been better.  Summary, testing concerns, and quality assessment have a few issues.
* **C** - Test coverage is not good; many tests are repetitive or unnecessary.  Tests and kinds
      of tests are only vaguely appropriate.  Summary, testing concerns, and quality
      assessment have major issues.
* **D** - Test coverage is horrible; tests do not do what they say, there aren't enough of them,
     and are not described at all.  Summary, testing concerns, and quality assessment are
     filled with errors, grammatical and factual.
* **F** - Test coverage is basically nonexistent; tests are testing the wrong thing entirely
     (e.g. a "usability test" which only checks a math function repeatedly) or missing.
     Summary, testing concerns, and quality assessment are unreadable or missing
    entirely.

## Format
Every group should have a title page with:
* The name of the project under test
* The names of the people in the group
* The title "IS2955 - FINAL DELIVERABLE"

First, include a short summary (a few paragraphs) of what you decided to test, what kinds of testing you are doing, and why.

Then, add a description of issues you faced when writing these tests and problems you would expect going forward based on your experiences.  Include here any additional tests or kinds of tests you would like to run to get a better assessment of the quality of the system.  This should also be a few paragraphs.

If applicable, I also expect an assessment of quality of the project under test.  This will include:

1. A list of any failed tests or problem areas
2. An overall assessment of quality
3. Your recommendation on whether or not the product is ready to be released

You should write this in the style of convincing a manager whether or not a system is ready to be released.  For certain projects (e.g., analysis of an algorithm), it may not be.  Please ask me ahead of time if you are unsure if you will need this section.

At the end of this section, note where your code (test code and code of project under test) is located, if applicable.

After this, there should be printouts or screen shots of the test execution results, if applicable.

There is no need to print out the code.  It should be put on a publicly-available site such as
GitHub BY THE BEGINNING OF CLASS.

## Grading
* Summary - 10%
* Testing concerns / Concerns going forward - 10%
* Assessment of Quality - 10% (if necessary - if not, Project worth 80%)
* Project - 70%

Reminder that all code (project under test AND test code) should be publicly available, or at least available to me.

Please feel free to email me at bill@billlaboon.com or come to office hours to discuss any problems you have.

I urge you to talk to me as soon as possible if you experience any problems.
